## The Problem BLockXRentals Solves:

There have been many instances of scams in the Car Rental Services. Sometimes, the renters charge more unnecessarily or the customers may not return the car. As such, BlockXRentals solves this problem by using Smart Contracts and the power of Blockchain. The contract calculates the Charge and Return-on-Return Ratio hence you cannot be overcharged. The customer will not get any money back if he fails to return the vehicle.

##  How to Use BlockXRentals:
The process is very simple and consists of namely only 4 Steps:

 ###  **Step 1**: Connect your Metamask Wallet.

## Who can use it:
Since we all know the Car Rental business has existed for decades. The basic workflow essentially involves a customer booking a car through a channel such as telephone, and taking temporary possession of the allotted car from the designated pick-up location, at the chosen date and time. This car rental management process ties together various activities comprising car inspection reports, selling an insurance policy for the rental duration, as well as contract management between the owner and the customer. The entire process, while familiar to most, has inherent operational inefficiencies built in due to the nature of activities. For instance, speeding violations during the car rental period involve multiple agencies cooperating with each other and can take weeks to close. New-age technologies like Blockchain can help reduce the process time and increase the efficiency in the entire value chain.

##  Problems faced:
We had initially planned to deploy the contract to Polygon Mumbai Testnet. However, after successfully deploying it, we ran into some issues while connecting it to the frontend. Unfortunately, we have not been able to resolve the issue. Hence,the final contract has been deployed to the Goerli Testnet.
